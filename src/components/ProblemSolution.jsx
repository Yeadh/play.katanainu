                <p>Katana Inu came into existence due to the lack of P2E content in the PC gaming space and the rise of low-resolution blockchain games. Additionally, conventional games don't provide a play-to-earn system for their players.</p>
                    <ul>
                  <li>More than 1 billion gamers have been playing games for years and earning nothing from their playtime. They spend hundreds of dollars buying skins and other in-game items, but they don't have the option to sell them. This is a loss on investment. </li>
