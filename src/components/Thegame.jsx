                            <h3>Katana Inu Game Modes</h3>
                            <p>Katana-Inu's primary game mode will be Battle-Royale, with a maximum of 60 players. Here, players can choose to squad up or go solo against a team of other players in an interactive open-world map. Katana Inu will also feature different game modes in smaller map arenas like 1v1 and 3v3. While the battle royale mode will launch in Q3 2023, the developers plan to introduce these more competitive game modes much later in the future.</p>
                            <p>NFTs play a crucial role in the Katana Inu game. They serve as skins and other important in-game assets or customizable items. These in-game items are strictly for aesthetic purposes and will provide no advantage in battle. There will also be many other exciting collectibles, including weapons, abilities, spells, poses, and skins that players can earn by simply playing the game.</p>
