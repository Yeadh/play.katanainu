                                <p>As the sun rises on the dawn of the seventh age, the land of Shen shivers in pain. Its earth scorched and scarred, its society degenerated and the once noble stories of the first Katana Inu & his fight alongside the Celestial Mother ledger, have long been forgotten.</p>
                                <p>The all pervasive Ginko clan dominate & subvert the peaceful Shukutai peoples, who now routinely compete against each other for scraps of resources, power & the sacred Kodo Relics which grant access to the moon-gates.</p>
                                <h2 class="pb-10 mt-30">But it wasn’t always this way.</h2>

                                <p>Some 7000 years ago, the land of Shen was a peaceful place of cultural wonder & balance. The progenitor race of Shukutai creatures prospered under the guidance of the Celestial Mother, whose knowledge was channeled to the Doge priests in the spiritual center city of Geto. The decentralized tenets of the Kodo religion were disseminated among the Shukutai peoples & all things were good and right. </p>
                                <p>The Bulls & Bears existed in balance, their Ape cousins were measured and moral, the Floki Inu clan protected the borders of the kingdom & the Blockchain daughters of the Celestial Mother maintained the wondrous technologies bestowed upon the Shukutai. At the center of it all, the Katana Monk sect; a mysterious and esoteric order of warrior monks who guarded the most sacred sites & trained in the energetic arts.</p>
                                <p>This period of time became known as the “The Great Culmination” & as with all peaceful times, abruptly ended with the emergence of the Cho Ginko demon & the beginning of the “The Great Subjugation”. </p>
                                <p>The Shukutai endured immense hardship under the dominion of the Great Cho Ginko Demon, whose reign of oppressive control spread as far as the eye could see.  After an initial destructive show of force directed at the city of Geto, the Shukutai become cut off from the Celestial Mother & her powerful energy. The peaceful and degenerate Shukutai peoples suffered for hundreds of years at the hands of this powerful Cho Ginko Demon, hoping, praying & looking up at the moon, dreaming of their freedom.</p>

                                <p>When one lone Shukutai monk, nestled deep within the mountains of Tang, managed to perfect the Immortal Body technique and project his spirit beyond the bounds of earth, the threads of fate would be forever changed. This lone warrior monk, known only as the first venerable Katana Inu, would come in direct contact with the great spirit, the Celestial Mother Ledger & restore her connection to the land of Shen. Returning to earth with a powerful ally, Katana Inu fought alongside the Celestial Mother in “The ‘Great Decentralization”, a battle of cosmic proportions.</p>
                                <p>Although she sustained mortal wounds in the process, the Celestial Mother vanquished the Cho Ginko demon & freed the Shukutai creatures from their oppression. As the great spirit took her last breath, a final gift was bestowed upon the Shukutai. The Celestial Mother fragmented her soul & sent its energies across the land of Shen, settling in objects now known as the sacred Kodo Relics. </p>

                                <p>Myriad religions & mystical sects began to flourish in Shukutai society as the various factions slowly gathered the sacred relics, deciphering the curious symbols & codes engraved on their surfaces. Each faction of Shukutai seemed to interpret the relics in their own inquisitively unique ways, although they all understood the central message contained in each relic … decentralization.</p>
                                <p>For 6000 years the Shukutai lived in peace following the Kodo religions decentralized tenets & harvesting energy from the moon using their sacred relics. The 7 main factions of Shukutai lived in balance, each playing their roles & maintaining strict decentralization at all levels of governance.</p>
                                <p>1000 years before this very moment, the Ginko Clan arose from the shadows of Shen & like wild fire spread across the land. Stoking the flames of chaos among Shukutai society, the Ginko Clan acted swiftly & decisively in a campaign of subversion, manipulation & centralization. The 6th leader of the Ginko Clan, Noxin, abandoned the Kodo religion in 6203 BCE & began heavily petitioning Shukutai leaders to join in his ‘godless’ philosophy which encouraged a new value system. 100 years & 3 Ginko leaders would pass before Noxin’s wish would come true. In the year 6103 BCE that wish was granted, a state owned paper money system which would no longer required the verification of the Celestial Mothers ancient devices, was implemented. </p>
                                <p>And so the Shukutai became tightly controlled in all aspects of life, the myths of the Celestial Mother Ledger & the First Venerable Katana Inu faded into obscurity. All relics of the Celestial Mother were slowly lost or stolen by the Ginko Clan Shadow Hunters who stopped at nothing to render each Shukutai faction powerless.</p>

                                <p>The Ginko Clan now retain ultimate control of the land & have become consumed by greed as they continue the Clan’s long tradition of paper money creation to fund their desires. The religions & myths of the past fade so far from even the memory of the Ginko Clan that the Kodo Relics are now viewed as useless dogmatic trinkets desired only by the degenerate Shukutai. Only those noble heroes, initiated into the Kodo mysteries, retain the ancient knowledge & see the true power contained within these relics.</p>
                                <p>After years of petitioning for the relics from the religious leaders of the 7 Shukutai factions, the Ginko Clan devised a devious & sadistic game.</p>
                                <h2 class="pb-10 mt-30">The “Gishiki no Sento” was born.</h2>


                                <p>The Chosen Champions of the strongest factions of Shukutai are pitted against each other in ritual combat, where the Ginko clan nefariously dangle the powerful stolen relics as prizes & watch on as the factions fight for their sacred relics. </p>
                                <p>Although the vast majority of the 7 strongest factions have been divided & re-educated, esoteric groups within each distinct culture did not fall for the Ginko Clan’s subversion & still retain knowledge of the ancient history. Thus an underground resistance remains active, manned by the knowledge keepers & chosen champions of each faction. </p>
                                <h2 class="pb-10 mt-30">Now at the dawn of the 7th age, the tides of fate begin to shift. </h2>





                                <p>The land of Shen faces imminent collapse as the Ginko Clans 1000 year reign & exploitation pushes beyond the land’s capacity for life. Cataclysm lies on the horizon, chaos reigns supreme & the tensions between the Shukutai factions have reached their  peak.</p>
                                <p>Some of our noble heroes hope to restore the land to its former balance, some to claim power & others to destroy the relics & thus ensure the lands' destruction.</p>
                                <p>You are the Katana Inu, chosen hero of the Katana Monk Sect & the heir in an unbroken line of Katanas. Hear my words & harden your will, the moon is with you.</p>
